# Simple-Sugar-scape-Model

# 1.	What (social) phenomena are you trying to model? 
-	The inequality of wealth distribution in modern day society, and how the system is rigged against the working class and for the benefit of the extremely rich.
# 2.	What modifications do you need to add to the model to study this? What additional rules, or code is needed? 
-	One agent out of the total ten agents will be purposefully assigned more sugar at the start than the rest, by a very wide margin. This rich agent will be allowed to enter the cells where other agents occupy it or not and take sugar from both the other agents and the cell. The other nine agents will not be allowed to enter any cell that is not empty.
# 3.	What kind of question does this answer? What is the hypothesis this is testing?
-	Is our society built upon fair principles? Is it truly possible to rise to a higher position in this life without taking shortcuts? And the hypothesis of this test is that no, our society is unfair, and that most of time, there truly is no way to acquire a better role than the one the system has assigned you since the beginning.
# 4.	 What do you expect will happen? What kind of emergent behavior should appear? If you do not know, feel free to guess. Try to frame this as a A-B Test problem, i.e. say normally the system does this, but when we add the rules, this thing will change. 
-	The chosen, rich agent will continue to grow richer, while the other nine will marginally grow their wealth but barely. The difference between the rich agent and the other nine will remain the same.
# 5.	What measurements/data do you need to collect to proof your point or answer your question?
-	The total sugar(wealth) accumulated by all the agents after the simulation is complete.
